              <p>
                I am majoring in Digital Forensics and Cyber Security. It is my
                goal to read at least two articals a week to keep up to speed on
                what is currently happening in this industry. While also going
                to school full-time. To learn more about cyber security and CISA

                <p>
                  For many years I worked as a child and family portrait
                  photographer. But my love is fine art Photography and finding
                  beauty in the everyday world around us. May that be natural
                  landscapes, industrial, or even micro Photography.

                  I grew up watching the Seattle Seahawks with my Mom and
                  listening to Bob Robertson announcing Cougar football games.
                  It wasn't until I moved to Seattle that the pleasure of
                  Baseball came into my life. But Washington sports are one of
                  my favorites. Click here to explore all the sports teams that
                  Washington offers from College to Professional.

                <p>
                  I grew up on a farm in eastern Washington. Growing up
                  surrounded by animals, you tend to need that companionship. I
                  have always had animals big and small in my life. These days I
                  have my cat Jenks and I am riding horses again. To explore the
                  farm where I am currently taking riding lessons please click
                  here.
