              Hello and welcome to my portfolio. This is a work in progress as I
              am a work in progress. I will be updating this site as I finish
              classes and obtain certificates along the way. I started my
              college career back in 2008 at Everett Community College for fine
              art Photography. Family obligations (namely a baby) got in the way
              of being able to finish up my degree. I am just a few credits shy
              of graduating; my goal is to finish that degree up in 2023.
              <br /><br />
              Today I am currently enrolled in Edmonds College for Cyber Defense
              and Digital Forensics. I didn’t just select this degree path, it
              kind of selected me. I was originally signed up for Web
              Application and Cloud Development. While completing the curriculum
              for web design I was invited to a lecture given by a former
              student who now works for Washington State Attorney General’s
              Office. Rebecca’s talk was transforming and inspiring, I wanted to
              know more and learn more about cyber security and how to do it. So
              that led me to take an introductory class called Digital Forensics
              and the Law. After that, I was hooked and halfway through the
              quarter changed my major committing myself to the study of digital
              forensics and cyber defense.
              <br /><br />
              In my spare time, I am a mother of four great kids who keep me
              busy with all their activities. We are a Disney family and tend to
              make several trips a year to Disneyworld. Sometimes we sneak in a
              Disneyland trip if we are visiting family.
              <br /><br />
              I am the main handyman and gardener around the house. I typically
              have three or four projects going at a time which keeps me busy,
              and it tends to be my stress relief. There is nothing better than
              getting your hands dirty and feeling like you have accomplished
              something at the end of the day. My list never gets shorter
              because I keep adding to it, I never want to run out of things to
              work on.
              <br /><br />
              Thank you for visiting my page, feel free to look around and
              please link up with me if our interests line up. I am always
              looking for networking opportunities.
