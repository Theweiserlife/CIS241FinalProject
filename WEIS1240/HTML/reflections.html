            <p>
              I have taken web design courses before this class, mostly taught
              online but all having certification behind them and at the end. I
              found the online courses to be more engaging and informative than
              I did this class unfortunately. Admittedly, things got off to a
              bumpy start with the course material not being available. I
              usually purchase my books ahead of class so that I have a start on
              all my classes. I was running two weeks behind in this class from
              the beginning and never really felt like I was able to catch up.
              Plus, there was so much busy work just to keep up with. I lost
              interest very quickly and just did the minimum to make sure I
              passed. Which is sad to say because web design was my major going
              into this class and Database design, but I really don’t like how
              Edmonds teaches the degree program.
              <br /><br />
              There wasn’t really anything that was taught in this class that I
              already hadn’t been taught online. I did go out and research
              flexbox a bit more and have played with that a bit. As well as
              delving into JavaScript more than I have in the past. I like
              creating my own stylesheets instead of putting all the design on
              the pages.
              <br /><br />
              My “Ah Ha” moment came when I found a new major that clicked with
              my need to grow into the tech industry as well as my love of
              puzzles and criminal justice. So, I have changed majors and am now
              going for Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity. The program seems
              more current and a lot more focused. I have been looking at this
              for a couple of quarters now, but this quarter I took CIS 201
              Digital Forensics and the Law which just sealed my resolve to
              switch majors. I will still get certified as a web designer on the
              side, but I will do it online and not through the College, I feel
              it is a much better option for me.
